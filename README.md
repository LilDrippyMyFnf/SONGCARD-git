# Welcome to the song card github.

what you will encounter here:

- Latest Updates + Code
- A Wiki

if you're planning on adding this to you're mod / recoding it, go to the [wiki](https://github.com/LilDrippyMyFnf/SONGCARD-git/wiki) and please credit me.

NOTE: there is no reason to fork this, if you counter a bug, report it on [issues](https://github.com/LilDrippyMyFnf/SONGCARD-git/issues), but you can use the .lua, 2 image assets, and the font if you're mod has a repo (also credit me for the 2nd time)
